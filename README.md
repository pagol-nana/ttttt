Now, you can go ahead and add the code for your package.

First, you need to create the file that will be loaded when your module is required by another application. For this tutorial, that will be the index.js file.

Inside the index.js file, add the code for your package.

For this tutorial, I will be creating a simple package called first-hello-npm. This package returns the string "Hello NPM!".
